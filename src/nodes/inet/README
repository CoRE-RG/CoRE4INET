The IPoRE feature allows for transmission of IPv4 Packets over AS6802 as well as AVB.


 Usage
=======

Use the core4inet.nodes.inet.RTIPHost as Node in your RT Ethernet Network.
For AS6802 communication this Node has to be extended with the required TT and RC buffers.
Connect an Application (e.g. an TCPApp) from the INET Framework or your own Application to the transport layer (e.g. TCP) within RTIPHost.

Each RTIPHost has an "filters" parameter, which is an xml based configuration for the IPoRE Module.
See IPv4oRE for documentation of the xml configuration.

An example of this feature is available in examples/inet/small_network
