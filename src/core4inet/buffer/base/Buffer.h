/**
 * @brief Base class for all buffer classes.
 *
 * Buffer, although packed with buffer-related functionality, does not do
 * anything useful by itself: one has to subclass from it and redefine one
 * or more virtual member functions to make it do useful work. These
 * functions are:
 *
 *    - void enqueue(inet::EtherFrame *newFrame)
 *    - inet::EtherFrame* dequeue()
 *
 * enqueue(inet::EtherFrame *newFrame) is called to queue a message in the buffer.
 * It must be implemented according to the correct buffer behaviour.
 *
 * dequeue() is called to get a frame from the buffer.
 *
 * @ingroup Buffer
