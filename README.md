# CoRE4INET

CoRE4INET is an open source extension to the [INET-Framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org/) for the event-based simulation of real-time Ethernet in the [OMNEST/OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) simulation system. It provides real-time Ethernet protocols like AS6802 and AVB. It was created by the [CoRE (Communication over Realtime Ethernet)](https://core-researchgroup.de/) research group at the [HAW-Hamburg (Hamburg University of Applied Sciences)](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/english.html).

## History
CoRE4INET was first introduced as TTE4INET at the 4th International Workshop on OMNeT++ (2011) along with the 4th International ICST Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques (2011). You can find the [publication](https://core.inet.haw-hamburg.de/assets/bibliography/eigene/sdkks-eifre-11.pdf) and [slides](https://core.inet.haw-hamburg.de/assets/bibliography/eigene/sdkks-eifre-11_Slides.pdf) here.

Since there were changes necessary to support OMNeT++ 4.2 and INET 2.0, it was completely redesigned. When more real-time Ethernet protocols were added the project was renamed from TTE4INET to CoRE4INET to show that it does not only contain time-triggered protocols.

## IMPORTANT
The CoRE4INET model is under continuous development: new parts are added, bugs are corrected, and so on. We cannot assert that the implementation will work fully according to the specifications. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE YOURSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MODELS YOU USE IN YOUR SIMULATIONS WORK CORRECTLY, AND YOU'RE GETTING VALID RESULTS.
