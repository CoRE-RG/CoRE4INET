DEBUGGING UNDER OS X WITH Xcode
===============================

PROBLEM
-------------------------------
Currently there is no propper gdb support in OS X (since OS X release 10.10).
You can install gdb by using port or homebrew but it does not work as expected.

WORK AROUND
-------------------------------
You can use Xcode and the lldb debugger on OS X to debug OMNeT++.
It is a bit less convenient, but at least it is a solution for the moment. 

PREREQUISITES
-------------------------------
Install XCode on your system and open the Xcode project in CoRE4INET/other.
You should see the source files in the "Project Navigator". If you are missing a source
file you can add it.

Build your OMNeT++ project in the OMNeT++ IDE and start it from the IDE or the commandline

DEBUGGING
-------------------------------
To attach the opp_run process of you simulation change to XCode and open the Menu:
"Debug"->"Attach to Process"->"opp_run"

You can now use the debugging controls in the "Debug" menu e.g. "Pause", "Step", etc.
If you want to set breakpoints open the desired source file in the "Project Navigator" and
click in front of the line you want the debugger to stop. With a right-click you get more
configuraion parameters using the "Edit Breakpoint..." option. You can also see all breakpoints
in the "Breakpoint Navigator"
