Demonstrates a small IEEE 802.1Q Network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

- The small network contains three hosts (node1, node2, node3) and a switch, which 
  connects these hosts.
  
- node1 sends Q traffic in vlan 0 with pcp 0 to node3.

- node2 sends BE traffic to node3, that is read from the examples.pcapng file.
