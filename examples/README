TTEthernet Model for INET Framework (TTE4INET)
==============================================

TTE4INET is an extension to the INET-Framework for the event-based
simulation of time-triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) in the OMNEST/OMNeT++
simulation system. It was created by the CoRE (Communication over Realtime
Ethernet) research group at the HAW-Hamburg (Hamburg University of Applied
Sciences).

Example simulations are grouped into the following subdirectories:

   rt-tictoc/             example that shows the usage of the API
   small_network/         example that shows a small network with traffic generation


   
The package's main README file contains links to additional info to help you
get started with the model.
