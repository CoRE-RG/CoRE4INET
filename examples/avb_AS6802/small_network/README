Demonstrates a small TTEthernet with AVB Network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

- The small network contains three hosts (node1, node2, node3) and a switch, which 
  connects these hosts.
  The cycle time is 5 ms (see omnetpp.ini)

- Via virtual link vl100 node1 sends time triggered (TT) messages to node2 and node3.
  Double buffers will be used.

- The nodes 1 and 2 are AVB Talkers. 1 provides an SR-Class A stream. 2 provides an SR-Class B stream. node3 is a AVB Listener and tries to reserve both Streams.

- Cross traffic may be send via the corresponding functionality of inet framework.
  For more details take a look at unit*.ini. Use the configuration With_Crosstraffic.
