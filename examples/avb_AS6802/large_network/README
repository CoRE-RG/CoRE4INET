The evaluations are based on a network that generates worst-case scenarios. It consists of ten nodes interconnected via
three switches to produce a bottleneck with high probability of interference. For all traffic classes, the longest path
between sender and receiver is four switching hops. In the network all links are configured with a bandwidth of 100
Mbit/s. The AVB configuration uses nodes 1 and 2 as talkers, while node 8 is the listener for both streams. Each stream
is configured to use 350B payload in a 125Î¼s class measurement interval, resulting in a total bandwidth of approx.
50Mbit/s (2 times 25Mbit/s). The time-triggered messages use a cycle time of 4ms and full size frames to generate
maximum interference. For each route, two messages are configured, resulting in a total bandwidth of 25 Mbit/s for
time-triggered traffic. Node 10 broadcasts full size best-effort cross-traffic in a 2ms to 3ms interval. All nodes also
reply with full size best-effort messages to generate traffic bursts.

The case study uses different parameters for time-triggered and best-effort traffic, while the configuration for AVB
remains the same. This allows to uphold the comparability of the AVB results through the whole evaluation.
