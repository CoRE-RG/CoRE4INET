Demonstrates a small IEEE 802.1Q Network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

- The small network contains three hosts (node1, node2, node3) and a switch, which 
  connects these hosts.

- Node1 sends messages in vlan 1 with priority 1 to node3.

- Node2 sends messages in vlan 0 with priority 7 to node3.

- Background cross traffic may be send between nodes. Use the configuration With_Crosstraffic.
