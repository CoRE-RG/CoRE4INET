Demonstrates a small IEEE 802.1Qbv Network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

- The small network contains three hosts (node1, node2, node3) and a switch, which 
  connects these hosts.
  The cycle time 500us (see omnetpp.ini)

- Node 1 sends Q traffic in vlan 0 with pcp 7. The Qbv gates in the devices are configured to handle it like TDMA traffic.

- Node 2 sends AVB Class B Stream 1 in vlan 2 with pcp 6. The switch uses a CBS to shape this traffic.
  
- Cross traffic may be send via all nodes. Use the configuration With_Crosstraffic.
