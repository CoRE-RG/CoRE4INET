Demonstrates a small TTEthernet Network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

- The small network contains three hosts (node1, node2, node3) and a switch, which 
  connects these hosts.
  The cycle time is 5 ms (see omnetpp.ini)

- Via virtual link vl100 node1 sends time triggered (TT) messages to node2 and node3.
  Double buffers will be used.

- Via virtual link vl101 node2 sends rate constrained (RC) messages to node3.
  Queued buffers will be used.
  
  - Via virtual link vl102 node1 sends time triggered (TT) messages to node2.
  Double buffers will be used.

- Cross traffic may be send via the corresponding functionality of inet framework.
  For more details take a look at unit*.ini. Use the configuration With_Crosstraffic.
