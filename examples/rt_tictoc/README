Demonstrates a small TTEthernet Network. Traffic generators send Ethernet frames directly.

- The small network contains three hosts (unit1, unit2, unit2) and a switch, which 
  connects these hosts.
  The cycle time is 5 ms (see omnetpp.ini)

- Via virtual link vl100 unit1 sends time triggered (TT) messages to unit2 and unit3.
  Double buffers will be used.

- Via virtual link vl101 unit2 sends rate constrained (RC) messages to unit3.
  Queued buffers will be used.

- Cross traffic may be send via the corresponding functionality of inet framework.
  For more details take a look at unit*.ini. Use the configuration With_Crosstraffic.
