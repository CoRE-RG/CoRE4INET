Demonstrates a small TSN IP Network. 

- The ip tsn small network contains node1, node2, node3, and a switch, which 
  connects these hosts. Additionally, there is node 4, which is directly connected to node 2.
  The cycle time 1000us (see omnetpp.ini)

- Node 1 sends Q traffic in vlan 0 with pcp 7. The Qbv gates in the devices are configured to handle it like TDMA traffic.
- Node 1 sends TCP traffic via AVB Class B Stream 27 with pcp 6 and TCP traffic via Q priority 3 in vlan 0
- Node 2 sends AVB Class B Stream 1 in vlan 2 with pcp 6. 
- Switch 1 uses a CBS to shape this traffic.
- Node 4 sends TCP traffic with pcp 3 in vlan 0 to node2
  
- Cross traffic may be send via all nodes. Use the configuration With_Crosstraffic.

- Switch uses IEEE 802.1 Qci per stream filtering and policing on its ports. Use the configuration With_Qci
