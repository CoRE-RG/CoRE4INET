ANDL README
=========================

These examples are configured in the .andl format.
ANDL (Abstract Network Description Language) is a format to describe networks in a simple way.
Using the ANDL Plugin for OMNeT++ you can translate the ANDL files to runnable OMNeT++ simulations.

More info about ANDL and the ANDL-Plugin can be found here: http://sim.core-rg.de
Information on how to install the Plugin can be found here: http://sim.core-rg.de/updates

If everything was installed correctly you should find the generated examples in simulations/examples_andl
